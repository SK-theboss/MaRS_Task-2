# MaRS_Task-2
*Platform:* Arduino Uno

*Languages Used:* Arduino Simplified C++ 

## *Overview*
*Aim:* 

To control a two-wheel drive mechanism using W, A, S, D keys (it has to be able to go forward, reverse, left and right ) 

*The Journey:* 
    
I was initially given the task of creating a color-controlled stepper motor system, and I successfully completed the implementation. Unfortunately, at the time, the stepper motor wasn't functional due to hardware issues. As a result, I was asked to shift my focus and instead work on controlling a two-wheel drive mechanism using the WASD keys. This alternative setup allowed for basic directional control of the system through serial inputs.
    Then I started working on the new task, and everything went smoothly. Within just half an hour, I was able to analyze the requirements, understand the environment, and compile a working code to control the two-wheel drive mechanism using an L293D motor driver. However, as success seemed within reach, I was asked to restart the work using a different module, since the L293D motor driver had been damaged by another contestant.
    I didnâ€™t give up despite the setback. I gave my 100% to the task and quickly adapted to the new hardware. I reworked the setup and successfully compiled the code using the MD10C R3 motor driver, ensuring the two-wheel drive mechanism was fully functional with the updated module.

*Cognitive Process and Scope of the task:*  
    
In a surface level, only direction pins are enough to accomplish this task, keeping the PWM pin values constant for the overall task. But, I imagined a two wheel balance scooter(hoverboard) in my mind. So, I regulated the PWM values accordingly for each and every condition. Example: For a left turn, the left wheel would stop and the right wheel would receive HIGH signal and greater PWM.
    This makes my project kind of unique and well-suited for a real time application.
    Also, to get the input from the user during runtime, firstly I used Keyboard function. Then I realised that, this was not compatible in Arduino Uno. Immediately, I switched to Serial.availabe. This was perfect and made my task easier.
    By this way, I accomplished the desired task.
  
## *Procedure:*

Pin Selections: -
    - Direction of motor: Any Digital Pin in Arduino UNO
    - PWM - pins with ~ (PWM pins).
    - Ground pins - common ground with the breadboard

character variable - choice

Starting a serial communication in 9600 baud rate.

Steps: -

1. Compile the code as required.
2. Fix the input and output pins from arduino
3. Assemble the motors and connect it to the MD10C R3.
4. Make sure that the polarities of power supply are connected properly.
5. Check the connectivity of the circuit.
