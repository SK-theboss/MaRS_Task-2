## ** Learnings & Approach of all problems**

###  *Light Dose*

####  Question 1 & Question 2: 
- I am not very much known to terminal commands in Linux.
- I just know some basic commands.

  *My Approach:*
- Gone through some you-tube vedios to get a idea about Linux Commands related to navigation, file handling, and permissions.
- Googled for unknown commands.
- I broke out the problem into individual checks and tested each block.
- Used echo and if-else blocks to validate system behavior step by step.
  
  *Script:*
- [light_1](./light_1st.sh)
- [light_2](./light_2nd.sh)
  
 *Screenshot of basic terminal commands done on terminal:*

###  *Medium Dose*

####  Question 1: Marker Navigation
- I just added 55 units to z co_ordinate to get new frame of reference
- And wrote a function to calculate distance from origin
- Got input co_ordinates from user


 *Script:*
- [medium-1](./medium_1st.py)
